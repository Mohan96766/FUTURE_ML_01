## 📊 How it Works
1. Clean and aggregate sales data into monthly totals.  
2. Prepare data in Prophet format (`ds` = date, `y` = sales).  
3. Fit Prophet model with yearly seasonality and holidays.  
4. Forecast sales for the next 12 months.  
5. Visualize forecast and components for trend and seasonality insights.  
6. Compare recent actual sales with forecast using confidence intervals.
